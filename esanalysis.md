# ES Analysis

*Generated: 2026-02-05 12:14:51*

Based on the provided charts for ES (S&P 500 E-mini Futures) covering the 5-minute, 15-minute, 1-hour, and 4-hour time frames, here is a comprehensive analysis.

### **Executive Summary**
The ES is currently in a **strong bearish correction within a larger macro range.** The market has experienced a violent intraday sell-off, dropping over 100 points from the ~6920 highs down to the ~6800 level.

Currently, price is attempting to stabilize near **6820-6840**. The immediate price action suggests a potential oversold bounce (relief rally), but the dominant momentum remains heavily bearish until key structural levels above 6880 are reclaimed.

### **1. Trend Analysis**
*   **Intraday (5m & 15m):** **Bearish with Neutralization.** The trend was vertically down, but the selling climax volume suggests temporary exhaustion. Price is moving sideways to slightly up, attempting to reconnect with the VWAP.
*   **Short-Term (1H):** **Bearish.** Lower highs and lower lows are clearly visible. The breakdown below 6880 was significant.
*   **Medium-Term (4H):** **Range-Bound/Corrective.** The market has rejected the 7000+ highs and is currently testing the bottom of the trading range established in mid-January.

### **2. Key Support & Resistance Levels**

| Type | Level | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Resistance 3** | **6920** | Major breakdown level; previous consolidation floor (15m/1H). |
| **Resistance 2** | **6880** | Previous support turned resistance; key level for bulls to reclaim (1H). |
| **Resistance 1** | **6855 - 6860** | **Critical Intraday Level.** Coincides with the 5m/15m VWAP and recent lower high. |
| **Current Price**| **~6845** | Trading in the pivot zone. |
| **Support 1** | **6820** | Current consolidation lows (5m chart). |
| **Support 2** | **6800 - 6805** | **Major Structural Support.** The "Stopping Volume" low on the 5m chart and the bottom of the 4H range from late January. |
| **Support 3** | **6760** | Next major downside target if 6800 fails (visible on 4H history). |

### **3. Technical Indicators & Patterns**

*   **VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price):**
    *   Visible on the 5m and 15m charts as the orange line. The price is currently trading *below* VWAP but approaching it from the downside. This often acts as dynamic resistance. A clean break and hold above the VWAP (~6855) is the first requirement for a bullish reversal.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):**
    *   **1H & 4H:** RSI dipped near or below 30 (Oversold). This indicates the sell-off is overextended and a mean-reversion bounce is likely.
    *   **5m:** RSI is showing **Bullish Divergence**. While price made equal/lower lows around 6800-6810, the RSI made higher lows, indicating selling momentum is waning.
*   **Volume:**
    *   **Climax Volume:** The 5m and 15m charts show a massive spike in volume at the absolute bottom (~6800). This is a classic "Stopping Volume" or "Capitulation" signature, often marking a temporary bottom.

### **4. Chart Patterns**
*   **5m Chart:** Forming a **Base/Consolidation Box** between 6810 and 6850.
*   **4H Chart:** The chart displays a potential **Double Top** or broad distribution pattern near 7040. The current leg down is testing the "neckline" support zone of the larger structure (6800 area).

### **5. Actionable Trade Scenarios**

#### **Scenario A: Bullish Relief Bounce (Counter-Trend)**
*   **The Setup:** Playing the oversold condition and the defense of the 6800 level.
*   **Trigger:** A 5-minute candle close above the VWAP (**~6855**).
*   **Target:** First target **6880** (previous breakdown point). Second target **6915**.
*   **Stop Loss:** Below the recent higher low consolidation at **6830**.

#### **Scenario B: Bearish Continuation (Trend Following)**
*   **The Setup:** Fade the rally into resistance. The trend is down, so rallies are liable to be sold.
*   **Trigger:** Rejection at the VWAP (**6855-6860**) or at the structural resistance (**6880**) with a bearish reversal candle (shooting star/engulfing).
*   **Target:** Retest of **6810**, then the psychological **6800**.
*   **Stop Loss:** Above the swing high of the rejection candle (e.g., 6865 or 6890 depending on entry).

#### **Scenario C: The Flush (Breakdown)**
*   **The Setup:** Structural failure of the macro range.
*   **Trigger:** A high-volume 15-minute close below **6800**.
*   **Target:** **6760** and potentially **6720**.
*   **Stop Loss:** A reclaim of 6815.

### **6. Risk Considerations**
*   **Knife Catching:** Buying at 6820 is trying to catch a falling knife. Wait for confirmation (breaking VWAP) before getting aggressive on the long side.
*   **Volatility:** The 5m candles are large. Ensure position sizing is reduced to accommodate wider stops.
*   **Context:** The 4H chart shows we are at a "Make or Break" level. If 6800 holds, we could see a large rotation back up to 7000 over the coming week. If it breaks, the correction deepens significantly.

**Summary Verdict:** Watch **6855 (VWAP)** closely. If price reclaims it, look for a rotation to 6880. If price fails there, expect a retest of 6800.

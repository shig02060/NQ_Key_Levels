# YM Analysis

*Generated: 2026-02-05 12:29:58*

Based on the provided charts for YM (Dow Jones E-mini Futures), here is a comprehensive technical analysis across the 5-minute, 15-minute, 1-hour, and 4-hour time frames.

### **1. Overall Trend Direction**

*   **Intraday (5m & 15m): Bearish.** The market experienced a significant sell-off from highs near 49,680 down to 48,920. While there is a minor relief bounce occurring, the price remains well below the key moving averages and VWAP.
*   **Intermediate (1H): Turning Bearish.** The trend has shifted from an uptrend to a correction. The price has rejected the 49,760 area (a double top) and is breaking down through consolidation zones.
*   **Macro (4H): Ranging / Neutral.** The market is stuck in a broad, choppy range between ~48,500 and ~49,800. Currently, the price is moving from the top of the range back toward the middle/bottom.

### **2. Key Support and Resistance Levels**

| Type | Price Level | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Resistance** | **49,760 - 49,800** | Major swing high / Top of the macro range (4H chart). |
| **Resistance** | **49,450 - 49,500** | Previous breakdown level; now overhead supply. |
| **Resistance** | **49,240 - 49,260** | Intraday dynamic resistance (VWAP on 5m/15m charts). |
| **Current Price**| **~49,150** | Trading in "No Man's Land" between intraday support and resistance. |
| **Support** | **48,900 - 48,920** | Intraday low (Day's Low) and psychological round number. |
| **Support** | **48,600 - 48,700** | **Critical Macro Support.** The bottom of the 4H range. |
| **Support** | **48,500** | Previous swing lows on the 4H chart. |

### **3. Notable Chart Patterns & Setups**

*   **Double Top (1H & 4H):** There is a clear rejection around the 49,800 level on the higher time frames. This M-pattern suggests a potential rotation back down toward the range lows (48,600).
*   **Intraday Sell-Off & Stabilization (5m):** Following the sharp drop, the 5-minute chart shows a potential temporary bottom around 48,920. The current price action resembles a **Bear Flag** or a weak retracement. If the price cannot reclaim the VWAP (orange line), further downside is likely.
*   **VWAP Rejection (15m):** The orange line (Volume Weighted Average Price) on the 15-minute chart is sloping downward. The price is currently trading below it, indicating sellers are in control of the average price for the session.

### **4. Indicator Analysis**

*   **VWAP (5m & 15m):** The VWAP is currently sitting around **49,240**. This acts as the "line in the sand" for intraday sentiment. As long as the price is below this line, the bears are in control. A rejection here confirms a short bias.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):**
    *   **5m/15m:** RSI hit oversold levels (<20) during the drop and has now recovered to neutral (~45-55). This "cool off" allows room for another leg down.
    *   **1H:** RSI is trending downward and is near 40, suggesting bearish momentum is building but not yet overextended.
    *   **4H:** RSI is hovering near 50, confirming the indecisive, ranging nature of the higher timeframe.

### **5. Potential Trade Opportunities**

#### **Scenario A: Bearish Continuation (High Probability)**
*   **The Setup:** Watch for a price rally into the **49,240 - 49,300** zone (testing the VWAP and previous breakdown levels).
*   **Trigger:** Look for bearish rejection candles (shooting stars, engulfing reds) or high volume selling at this level.
*   **Target:** First target is the intraday low at **48,920**. Second target is the macro support at **48,700**.
*   **Invalidation:** A strong 15-min close above 49,350.

#### **Scenario B: Aggressive Counter-Trend Long (Scalp)**
*   **The Setup:** Price returns to test the **48,900 - 48,920** support zone.
*   **Trigger:** Look for a "Double Bottom" formation on the 5-minute chart with RSI divergence (price makes a lower low, RSI makes a higher low).
*   **Target:** Back to VWAP at **49,200**.
*   **Invalidation:** A clean break below 48,880 triggers a stop loss.

#### **Scenario C: Macro Range Play (Swing)**
*   **The Setup:** Wait for the price to reach the major 4H support at **48,600**.
*   **Trigger:** If the price stabilizes here, enter long expecting a rotation back to the middle of the range.
*   **Target:** 49,200+.

### **6. Risk Considerations**

*   **Volume Spikes:** The 1H chart shows massive volume on the red candles, indicating institutional selling. Fighting this momentum is risky without clear confirmation of a bottom.
*   **Choppy Macro:** Because the 4H chart is ranging, trend-following strategies might get "chopped up" if you hold too long. Take profits at predefined levels rather than hoping for a massive breakout.
*   **News/Events:** Always check the economic calendar. A sudden news event can invalidate technical levels, especially in a volatile index like the Dow (YM).

**Summary:** The market is currently undergoing an intraday correction within a larger sideways range. The path of least resistance is currently **down** toward 48,700, provided price stays below the 49,250 VWAP resistance.

# NQ Analysis

*Generated: 2026-02-05 12:14:07*

Based on the analysis of the 5-minute, 15-minute, 1-Hour, and 4-Hour charts for NQ (Nasdaq 100 Futures), here is a comprehensive summary.

### **Executive Summary**
The NQ is currently in a **strong bearish trend** across short and medium time frames, having sold off aggressively from the 26000 highs down to the current 24600 region. However, price action is currently sitting at a critical **macro support level (~24500)** visible on the 4H chart. The market is pausing here, deciding whether to bounce (technical correction) or break down further (trend continuation).

### **Technical Analysis by Time Frame**

#### **1. Intraday Micro-Structure (5-Min & 15-Min Charts)**
*   **Trend:** Bearish but consolidating. After a steep drop from ~25040, the price has stabilized between **24550 and 24800**.
*   **Dynamic Resistance (Orange Line):** On both charts, the orange moving average/indicator has acted as perfect dynamic resistance. Every attempt to rally back to this line has been met with selling pressure (notably at 24900 and 24800).
*   **Volume:** There was a massive volume spike during the capitulation drop to 24550 (visible on the 5-min chart around 14:30). Subsequent buying volume is weaker, suggesting a lack of aggressive buyers so far.
*   **RSI:** Hovering between 40-60 on the 5-min chart, indicating the immediate selling pressure has neutralized, and the market is waiting for the next catalyst.

#### **2. Swing Perspective (1-Hour Chart)**
*   **Trend:** Clearly Bearish. The chart shows a series of lower highs and lower lows starting from Feb 3.
*   **Pattern:** The move down from 25600 was impulsive. We are seeing a potential "Bear Flag" or consolidation box forming at the lows.
*   **RSI:** The RSI dipped into oversold territory (<30) and is currently curling up slightly. This often precedes a relief bounce or a sideways consolidation period before trend resumption.

#### **3. Macro Perspective (4-Hour Chart)**
*   **Context:** This chart provides the most crucial context. The area of **24500 - 24600** was a significant swing low/support zone around Jan 20. We have returned to this "scene of the crime."
*   **Candlestick Setup:** The most recent completed 4H candle appears to be a **Hammer or Doji**, suggesting seller exhaustion at support. The current live candle is green, attempting to validate that support.
*   **RSI:** Approaching oversold levels (near 30), which historically on this chart leads to a bounce (as seen on Jan 20).

### **Key Support & Resistance Levels**

| Level Type | Price Zone | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Major Resistance** | **25,100 - 25,200** | Breakdown level; heavy supply zone. |
| **Intraday Resistance** | **24,800 - 24,850** | Top of current consolidation box & testing the moving average. |
| **Pivot / Resistance** | **24,700** | Mid-range resistance. |
| **Current Price** | **~24,680** | Trading within the range. |
| **Immediate Support** | **24,540 - 24,550** | Intraday double bottom lows. |
| **Critical Support** | **24,480 - 24,500** | Major 4H structural support. **The Line in the Sand.** |
| **Next Downside Target** | **24,200** | If 24,500 fails, price likely flushes to here. |

### **Potential Trade Opportunities & Scenarios**

#### **Scenario A: The "Dead Cat Bounce" (Counter-Trend Long)**
*   **Thesis:** Sellers are exhausted hitting the major 24500 4H support.
*   **Trigger:** Look for a clear 5-min or 15-min candle close above **24,700** or a double bottom retest of 24,550 that holds.
*   **Target:** 24,800 (first target) and 25,000 (extended target/gap fill).
*   **Stop Loss:** Tight stop below 24,520.

#### **Scenario B: Bearish Continuation (Trend Following)**
*   **Thesis:** The consolidation is a "Bear Flag" and the 4H support will fail.
*   **Trigger:** A high-volume breakdown below **24,500**.
*   **Target:** 24,200.
*   **Alternate Entry:** Rejecting the **24,800** resistance level. If price rallies to 24,800 and prints a bearish reversal candle (shooting star), enter short.

### **Risk Considerations**
1.  **Don't Short the Lows:** Shorting right at 24,600 is risky because you are pressing into major 4H support. Risk/reward favors waiting for a bounce to short *or* a confirmed breakdown.
2.  **Volatility:** The ranges are wide (100+ point candles). Position sizing should be reduced to accommodate wider stops.
3.  **Volume Check:** Watch the volume on any bounce. If the price rises on low volume, it is likely a trap (bear flag) and will roll over.

### **Verdict**
The market is **Bearish** but at **Support**. The path of least resistance is down, *however*, a relief bounce from 24,500 toward 24,800 is a high probability before the next major decision is made. Watch 24,500 closely; if that breaks, the selling will accelerate.
